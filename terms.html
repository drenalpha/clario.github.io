      At Clario, we strive to deliver products that exceed expectations. Every guide, tool, 
      and resource is designed to provide at least 160% of the value compared to its price.

    <p>
      We value your privacy and transparency. When you purchase through Paddle (our payment 
      provider), certain information such as name, email address, and billing details may be 
      collected to process your order securely. Paddle may also collect additional data to 
      improve transaction reliability and compliance.

    <p>
      At Clario, we may collect non-sensitive data such as your country or region to better 
      understand product interest in different areas. This helps us provide relevant updates 
      and improvements.
